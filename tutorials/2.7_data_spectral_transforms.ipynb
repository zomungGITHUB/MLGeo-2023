    "The wavelet transform projects the time series onto a 2D space of *time* and *scale* axis. The *scale* is a representation of the frequency scale of the data. The waveletn transforms uses a series of functions called *wavelets* to linearly decompose the signals. Unlike the *sine* functions of the Fourier transform, the *wavelets* have finite durations and are localized in time:\n",
